# Instructions

### To get the project to work in vscode(initial project setup should be complete before, follow packet-utility-setup-linux.md):

* get the java extension pack from the vscode extensions store.
* get the lombok extension from the vscode extensions store.
* create a multiroot workspace with the 3 project folders as the subfolders.
* Make sure tpm simulator and mockmds is running.
* Run the mosipPacketCreatorApplication.java in mosip-packet-creator from vscode gui
* It should initialize without error(you may see warnings but no errors) and you should be able to see the swagger interface at the localhost.
